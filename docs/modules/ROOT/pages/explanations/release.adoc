= Releasing K8up

The release process is automated all the way through.
It starts when a maintainer pushes a new git tag.
This will trigger a GitHub Action which will, in turn, create:

- A GitHub release with a changelog based on the merged pull requests.
- A build of the Docker image, which is pushed to https://ghcr.io/k8up-io/k8up[GitHub Container Registry] and https://quay.io/repository/k8up-io/k8up[Quay.io].
- A new version selector in the documentation if the version is minor or major.

This process mostly relies on https://goreleaser.com/[GoReleaser].

== Git Tag

Note that we use the following format `v0.0.0` for git tags, see `git tags`.
We follow https://semver.org/[SemVer].
