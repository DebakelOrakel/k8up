= Supported Kubernetes Versions

K8up officially has two support streams:

. Recent stable Kubernetes version
. OpenShift `v4.8` or newer

K8up v1 supports legacy Kubernetes clusters such as OpenShift `3.11` (Kubernetes 1.11) as long VSHN (the company behind K8up) operates OpenShift `3.11` with K8up installed.
However, some new features are not supported on Kubernetes < `1.16`, e.g. High Availability with Leader election.

With K8vup v2, support for OpenShift 3.11 has been dropped since their Kubernetes version is too old to support `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1` CustomResourceDefinitions.

See the {page-origin-url}[Repository,window=_blank] which upstream Kubernetes version is supported.
